		<dct:abstract>This ontology covers exotic options, a category of options contracts that differ from traditional options in their payment structures, expiration dates, and strike prices. The underlying asset or security can vary with exotic options allowing for more investment alternatives. Exotic options are hybrid securities that are often customizable to the needs of the investor, and most are traded over the counter (OTC).</dct:abstract>

		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">option whose exercise terms involve a payoff determined by the average underlying price (either the strike price or the settlement price) of the underlying asset over a predetermined period</skos:definition>
		<skos:example xml:lang="en">For an Asian call option using arithmetic averaging and a 30-day period for sampling the data: On Nov. 1, a trader purchased a 90-day arithmetic call option on stock XYZ with an exercise price of $22, where the averaging is based on the value of the stock after each 30-day period. The stock price after 30, 60, and 90 days was $21.00, $22.00, and $24.00. The arithmetic average (mean) is (21.00 + 22.00 + 24.00) / 3 = 22.33. The profit is the average minus the strike price 22.33 - 22 = 0.33 or $33.00 per 100 share contract. As with standard options, if the average price is below the strike price, the loss is limited to the premium paid for the call options.</skos:example>
		<skos:note xml:lang="en">The averaging can be either a geometric or arithmetic average.</skos:note>

		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">These options allow the buyer to purchase (or sell) the underlying asset at the average price instead of the spot price. There are various ways to interpret the word &apos;average,&apos; and that needs to be specified in the options contract. Typically, the average price is a geometric or arithmetic average of the price of the underlying asset at discreet intervals, which are also specified in the options contract. Because of the averaging feature, Asian options reduce the volatility inherent in the option; therefore, Asian options are typically cheaper than European or American options. They are used by traders who are exposed to the underlying asset over some time, such as consumers and suppliers of commodities, etc.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

Barrier options typically have cheaper premiums than traditional vanilla options, primarily because the barrier increases the chances of the option expiring worthless.

		<skos:example xml:lang="en">For example, assume a trader wants to have an option position for the updated XYZ Inc. earnings release. They think the stock will have a big move, but they are not sure in which direction. The earnings release is in one month, so the trader decides to buy a chooser option that will expire about three weeks after the earnings release. They believe this should provide enough time for the stock to make a significant move if it is going to make one, and fully digest the earnings release. Therefore, the option they choose will expire in seven to eight weeks. The chooser option allows them to exercise the option as a call if the price of XYZ rises, or as a put if the price falls. At the time of the chooser option purchase, XYZ is trading at $28. The trader chooses an at-the-money strike price of $28 and pays a premium of $2 or $200 for one contract ($2 x 100 shares). The buyer can&apos;t exercise the option prior to expiry since it is a European option. At expiry, the trader will determine if they will exercise the option as a call or put. Assume the price of XYZ at the time of expiry is $31. This is higher than the strike price of $28, therefore the trader will exercise the option as a call. Their profit is $1 ($31 - $28 - $2) or $100. If XYZ is trading between $28 and $29.99 the trader will still choose to exercise the option as a call, but they will still be losing money since the profit is not enough to offset their $2 cost. $30 is the breakeven point on the call. If the price of BAC is below $28, the trader will exercise the option as a put. In this case, $26 is the breakeven point ($28 - $2). If the underlying is trading between $28 and $26.01 the trader will lose money since the price didn&apos;t fall enough to offset the cost of the option. If the price of BAC falls below $26, say to $24, the trader will make money on the put. Their profit is $2 ($28 - $24 - $2) or $200.</skos:example>

		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">A chooser option is an option contract that allows the holder to decide whether it is a call or put prior to the expiration date. Chooser options usually have the same strike price and expiration date regardless of what decision the holder makes. Because the option could benefit from upside or downside movement, chooser options provide investors a great deal of flexibility and thus may cost more than comparable vanilla options. Chooser options are typically European style, and have one strike price and one expiration date regardless of whether the option is exercised as a call or put.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">A cliquet is a cash-settled, exotic option that settles at predetermined dates and then resets its strike price based on the price of the underlying security at the time of settlement. Each new option within the cliquet enters into force when the previous option expires. The total premium and the exact reset dates are known at the time of transacting a cliquet. Investors can opt to receive their payout when each option expires or wait until the entire series plays out.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">A cliquet is a series of forward start options, all related to each other. Each forward start option represents the advance purchase of a put, or call, option with an at-the-money (ATM) strike price to be determined at a later date, typically when the option becomes active. A forward start option becomes active at a specified date in the future. The premium is paid in advance, while the time to expiration and the underlying security are established at the time the forward start option is purchased. If at the first settlement date the underlying security trades below the strike price of the option (for a call), then it expires worthless and resets to the price of the underlying security at the time of settlement. If at the end of the next settlement the underlying security trades above the new strike, the holder may elect to receive the difference between the market price of the underlying security and the strike price. Alternatively, the holder can let it ride to receive the sum of all payouts at maturity. The main advantage of initiating a cliquet is, if an investor expects volatility to rise, they can lock in their profits at predetermined levels and thus maximize their overall portfolio return.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

For example, if the underlying or basket of underlyings reached or exceeded 102% of its initial level at the end of year one, a coupon of 6% would be paid. At the end of year two, if the underlying reached or exceeded 104% of its initial level, another 6% coupon would be paid. The coupon in the final year would be 6% if the underlying reached or exceeded 106%. The coupon should exceed the performance level of the underlying, otherwise the investor would achieve the same result by investing directly in the underlying.</skos:example>

		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">exotic option that is fully specified with respect to a set expiry date, underlying asset and other parameters, purchased and paid for on initiation, but that becomes active at a set activation date with a strike price determined at the time of activation</skos:definition>
		<skos:example xml:lang="en">For example, assume that two parties agree to enter into a call forward start option on XYZ stock. It is September and they agree that the forward start option will activate on January 1 at the money. That means on January 1 the strike price for the option will be the price that stock is trading at on that day. The option will expire in June. The exact strike price is unknown, but the parties do know the strike and underlying&apos;s price will be the same at activation. They can look at current six-month options (January to June) and assess volatility to determine a premium for the option. They agree to trade one contract, equivalent to 100 shares of the underlying stock. They decide on a premium of $40, or $4,000 for the contract ($40 x 100 shares). The call buyer agrees to pay the $4,000 now (September), even though the option doesn&apos;t activate till January. On January 1, assume the stock price is $400. The strike is set at $400, and an option is now a vanilla option with a June expiry. At the June expiry, assume XYZ is trading at $420. In this case, the option is worth $20 ($420 - $400 strike). If they settle in cash, the buyer receives $2,000, or if they exercise, they receive 100 shares at $400 and can keep them, or sell them at $420 to make $2,000. Notice that this still results in a loss for the buyer, since they paid $4,000 but are only receiving back $2,000. To make money on the call, the price of the underlying needs to move above the strike price plus the premium. Therefore, if the price moves up to $450 by expiration, the option is worth $50 ($450 - $400 strike), and the buyer receives $5,000. That&apos;s a net profit of $1,000 over their $4,000 cost. If the underlying is trading below the $400 strike at expiry, the call option expires worthless and the buyer&apos;s premium is lost ($4,000 profit to the seller).</skos:example>
		<skos:example xml:lang="en">For example, the people buying/selling the option could specify that the strike will be at the money (ATM) at activation, or 3% or 5% in the money or out of the money (OTM). Since it is a customized contract, they can negotiate any terms they want.</skos:example>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">Forward start options typically attempt to keep future strike prices at the money or near the money. In this way, the holder will have the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) the underlying asset in the future at or near the then-current market price. Knowing where the strike price will be in relation to the underlying&apos;s price makes it easier to come up with the premium (cost) of the option, which is also typically determined and paid at the initiation of the contract prior to the activation date. If, at the expiration date, the underlying trades below the strike price of the option (for a call), then it expires worthless. If the underlying is above the strike (for a call), then the holder exercises it and owns the underlying at the strike price. For a put option, if the underlying is below the strike price, the option has value and will be sold or exercised to realize a gain. If the underlying is above the strike price, the option will expire worthless. Typically, as with most options, the holder may sell the option if it is in the money and take the cash instead of exercising the option. Since it is an exotic option, the seller and buyer of the option may also agree to settle the option with cash instead of delivering the underlying. Once a forward start option becomes active (strike price is set), then the option is valued like a vanilla option.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">The only unknown for the contract is the strike price. In terms of pricing the contract, the future price of the underlying asset is also unknown.

If the price of the underlying security reaches $90, the option comes into existence and becomes a vanilla option with a strike price of $100. Thereafter, the holder of the option has the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price of $100, even though it is trading below $90. It is this right that gives the option value. The put option remains active until the expiration date, even if the underlying security rebounds back above $90. However, if the underlying asset does not fall below the barrier price during the life of the contract, the down-and-in option expires worthless.

Some of the most common include: (a) Altiplano options: Altiplano options provide investors with the features of both a traditional vanilla option along with a coupon payment, (b) Annapurna options: coupon rates are determined by the performance of the basket&apos;s worst-performing security when it drops under a specified range, (c) Everest options: Everest options place a long-term limit on an investor&apos;s option while offering a payout based on the lagging performers in the basket, (d) Atlas options: this type of option eliminates both the best - and worst - performing stocks in a basket of securities, and (e) Himalayan options: traders receive a payout based on the basket&apos;s best performing stock; payouts are provided on multiple dates.</skos:example>

		<skos:example xml:lang="en">A best of assets plus cash rainbow effectively has n + 1 payoff possibilities. If we consider a 2 asset &quot;best of plus cash&quot;, the payoff at expiry is a choice between Asset 1, Asset 2, or the predetermined cash amount. There is no strike price and the payoff is given as: Rainbow = max(S1, S2, Cash;T)</skos:example>
		<skos:example xml:lang="en">An asset maximum or minimum payout rainbow is similar to the best of n assets plus cash, with the exception that no cash payoff is possible and there is a strike price for this type of option. The payoff of a call and put are given as: Rainbow-Call = max[0, max(S1, S2) - X] Rainbow-Put = max[0, X - max(S1, S2)] Minimum of n Assets. The counterpart to a maximum of n assets, this rainbow pays out the value of the underperformer of the n assets. The payoff for minimum of 2 asset rainbow calls and puts are given as: Rainbow-Call = max[0, mainS1, S2) - X] Rainbow-Put = max[0, X - min(S1, S2)]</skos:example>
		<skos:example xml:lang="en">Better of n Assets This type of rainbow is similar to the best of n assets plus cash but with the exception that there is no possible cash payoff, and X is set to 0. With this in mind, a better of 2 assets rainbow is essentially a two-asset call option, with a payoff being: Rainbow = max[0, max(S1, S2)] Worse of n Assets Essentially the opposite to the better of n assets, with the payoff being on the asset with the lower value. We can give the payoff for this option on 2 assets as: Rainbow = max[0, min(S1, S2)]</skos:example>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">Rainbbow options can speculate on the best performer in the group or minimum performances of all the underlying assets at one time. Each underlying may be called a color so the sum of all of these factors makes up a rainbow. These structures can be rather exotic and made for institutional clients when referring to financial assets. Rainbow options can be structured in many ways depending on how the performances of each underlying asset are considered. Some pay off based on the best or worst performance among the underlying assets. In other words, it looks at the top or bottom performance and pays off based on that single asset. These are sometimes called &apos;best of&apos; or &apos;worst of&apos; rainbow options.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">Rainbow options are usually calls or puts on the best or worst of n underlying assets. Like a basket option, which is written on a group of assets and pays out on a weighted-average gain on the basket as a whole, a rainbow option also considers a group of assets, but usually pays out on the level of one of them. A simple example is a call rainbow option written on FTSE 100, Nikkei and S&amp;P 500 which will pay out the difference between the strike price and the level of the index that has risen by the largest amount of the three.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
