Because an auto loan is a &apos;secured&apos; type of loan, the vehicle that is being financed is used as collateral (i.e. if the borrower fails to repay the loan, the vehicle may be seized by the lender).</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">Home equity loans allow the borrower to borrow against the difference between the fair market value of the property, as determined by an appraisal, and the amount of any outstanding debt on that property, which is typically a first mortgage. Common practice is to set the maximum amount that can be borrowed of up to 80 percent of the fair market value less any outstanding debt.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">This is both a revolving line of credit and a mortgage, in that the collateral for the revolving line of credit in this case is some real estate, which is a defining fact for a mortgage. This form of product can either have an increase or decrease in principal, according to the actions of the borrower. These may also be used in the formation of asset pools for asset backed securities.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
