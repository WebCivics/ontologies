Redemption is made at least in the amount of the conditional capital protection at maturity, provided that no credit event by the reference entity has occurred. Conditional capital protection only applies to the nominal amount and not to the purchase price. The general functioning of a capital guaranteed structured instrument is as follows: the notional amount is split into a zero bond, that will deliver the capital guarantee at maturity, and the difference between the zero bond&apos;s value (= present value of the guarantee level at maturity) and the notional amount is used for structuring the performance component with options which deliver the agreed pay-off profile of the structured instrument.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

Structured finance instruments are typically presented to large financial institutions or companies with complicated financing needs that are unsatisfied with conventional financial products.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

		<fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">The redemption at the end of the term is determined on the basis of the performance and final fixing of the underlying asset: a redemption at the nominal value is guaranteed as long as the underlying asset has not touched its barrier during relevant barrier monitoring. If the underlying asset has touched its barrier but is again above the strike price at final fixing, the nominal price is also repaid. Nevertheless, if the underlying asset has touched its barrier during barrier monitoring and closes below the strike price at final fixing, the underlying asset is delivered or cash compensation paid, provided that no credit event by the reference entity has occurred. Depending on the characteristics of the product, either a coupon or a discount to the underlying asset can apply. A coupon is paid out regardless of the performance of the underlying asset, provided that no credit event by the reference entity has occurred.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
