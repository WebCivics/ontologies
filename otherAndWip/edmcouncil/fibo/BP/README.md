# Business Process (BP)

This directory contains ontologies belonging to the Business Process (BP) domain. This domain includes ontologies that define financial process flows, such as securities issuance and transaction workflows. In the case of securities issuance process models, these are provided in order to be able to represent reference data concepts that are dependent on the process by which a security was issued. Transaction process semantics provide the basis for the temporal dimension of securities and derivatives transactions.
