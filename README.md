# TheCharter.eco ontology work

This project aims to produce the ontological frameworks required by biosphere agents to supplement those already made for other concepts.

Human Rights Acts (such as those curated by the UN) couldn't be found in an RDF / Semantic Web Format.  This is one of the many components to many important concepts relating to our natural world and personhood, for natural persons (homo Sapiens) that doesn't appear to be readable by AI at present.   So this disaffects 'semantic inferencing'

Other ontological works will be built on top of this, alongside more functionally useful capacities that'll be built into a .eco site in time.
