## W3C Ontologies
W3C is the Primary Producer of Semantic Web Technologies and therefore also Semantic Web enabling Ontologies. 

Various W3C related ontologies, however not presently sure which version relates to what, not all are sourced from W3C Directly. etc.

Ontologies related to the [W3C PERMANENT IDENTIFIER COMMUNITY GROUP](https://www.w3.org/community/perma-id/) are now generally made available via the [Perma-id/w3id.org](https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org) repo.
