An offering may be linked to multiple unit price specifications that specify alternative prices for non-overlapping sets of conditions (e.g. quantities or sales regions) or with differing validity periods. \n\nA unit price specification is characterized by (1) the lower and upper limits and the unit of measurement of the eligible quantity, (2) by a monetary amount per unit of the product or service, and (3)  whether this prices includes local sales taxes, namely VAT.\n\t\nExample: The price, including VAT, for 1 kg of a given material is 5 Euros per kg for 0 - 5 kg and 4 Euros for quantities above 5 kg.\n\nThe eligible quantity interval for a given price is specified using the object property gr:hasEligibleQuantity, which points to an instance of gr:QuantitativeValue. The currency is specified using the gr:hasCurrency property, which points to an ISO 4217 currency code. The unit of measurement for the eligible quantity is specified using the gr:hasUnitOfMeasurement datatype property, which points to an UN/CEFACT Common Code (3 characters).\n\t\nIn most cases, the appropriate unit of measurement is the UN/CEFACT Common Code \"C62\" for \"Unit or piece\", since a gr:Offering is defined by the quantity and unit of measurement of all items included (e.g. \"1 kg of bananas plus a 2 kg of apples\"). As long at the offering consists of only one item, it is also possible to use an unit of measurement of choice for specifying the price per unit. For bundles, however, only  \"C62\" for \"Unit or piece\" is a valid unit of measurement.\n\nYou can assume that the price is given per unit or piece if there is no gr:hasUnitOfMeasurement property attached to the price.\n\t\nWhether VAT and sales taxes are included in this price is specified using the property gr:valueAddedTaxIncluded (xsd:boolean).\n\t\nThe price per unit of measurement is specified as a float value of the gr:hasCurrencyValue property. The currency is specified via the gr:hasCurrency datatype property. Whether the price includes VAT or not is indicated by the gr:valueAddedTaxIncluded datatype property.\n\nThe property priceType can be used to indicate that the price is a retail price recommendation only (i.e. a list price). \n\nIf the price can only be given as a range, use gr:hasMaxCurrencyValue and gr:hasMinCurrencyValue for the upper and lower bounds.\n\nImportant: When querying for the price, always use gr:hasMaxCurrencyValue and gr:hasMinCurrencyValue.\n\nNote 1: Due to the complexity of pricing scenarios in various industries, it may be necessary to create extensions of this fundamental model of price specifications. Such can be done easily by importing and refining the GoodRelations ontology.\n\nNote 2: For Google, attaching a gr:validThrough statement to a gr:UnitPriceSpecification is mandatory. \n",
